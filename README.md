# Artem's Project 2 for Cloud DevOps Engineer course

to create network stack, please run 
`./create.sh ArtProject2-network network.yml network-params.json`

to create servers stack, please run 
`./create.sh ArtProject2-servers servers.yml servers-params.json`

when server stack finishes creation, it creates an output : Load Balancer Url

currently it is: http://udacityproject2-app-elb-1158260195.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/
it may change in the future.
